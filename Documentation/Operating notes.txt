Operating Notes:

Right hand signals should be used.

Service frequencies are much lower in the simulation than in real life in order to make it operable by one person.  Nevertheless when all services are operating it is still quite intense.  It begins fairly gently as each line's services are brought in at successive intervals of two minutes, but after 30 minutes services are running on all lines.

The simulation runs for about 12 hours at full capacity but thereafter trains return gradually to their overnight stabling positions with the last train finishing at 20:00

Trains that change to new services often need routes setting within a minute, so the 'Actions Due' list should be watched carefully, especially if operating at higher than normal timetable speeds.

Please be aware that some services terminate and turn round at stations and others at sidings ('garages' in French).  Until you become familiar with which is which please check the train information window as each train approaches the terminus prior to setting its route.

When approaching termini try to route trains into departure platforms whenever possible so that later arrivals are not held up unnecessarily waiting for an earlier train to depart.
